# From-Scratch

A modest project for machine learning models built from scratch

## Project Overview

This project is dedicated to the implementation of machine learning models from scratch using Python and essential libraries such as NumPy. The primary goal is to deepen understanding of the underlying principles of machine learning algorithms by coding them manually, without relying on pre-built libraries like scikit-learn.

## Implemented Models

### 1. Linear Regression

- **Source Code**: `src/`
- Implementation of a simple linear regression model, including gradient descent optimization.

## Project Structure

- **`src/`**: Contains the source code for the implemented models.
- **`data/`**: Placeholder for any data required for testing the models.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter Notebooks showcasing the models in action.
- **`graphs/`**: Placeholder for graph-based machine learning models.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AndreiCanovas/from-scratch
   cd from-scratch
